      <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Prime Copy Terms And Conditions</h1>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Prime Copy (hereinafter—‘Service’) is a service that allows traders (hereinafter—‘Copiers’) to copy trades from other traders (hereinafter—‘Masters’), and can be activated by selecting ‘Start Copying’.
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
        <li className="mb-2">
          The Copier undertakes to do the following to apply for the Service:
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li className="mb-1">be registered and logged in as a client on the Prime website</li>
            <li className="mb-1">add money to the Wallet</li>
            <li className="mb-1">initiate copying.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          The Copier is entitled to do the following:
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li className="mb-1">copy any number of Masters (the Copier Area lists all current subscriptions)</li>
            <li className="mb-1">close any copied trade manually at any time in the Copier Area</li>
            <li className="mb-1">
              unsubscribe from the Master and stop copying the Master’s trades by clicking ‘Stop Copying’. To unsubscribe, the Copier needs to have all the trades closed. Upon unsubscription, all funds invested with the Master and the profit return to the Copier's Wallet
            </li>
            <li className="mb-1">set the size of copy proportion for every particular Master. This option is explained in detail in sub-clause 4.4. of these Terms and Conditions</li>
            <li className="mb-1">add support funds to protect the investment from unexpected market movements. These funds are used to support Copier's trading strategy when the market fluctuates and do not influence the profit directly.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">The Service is available on the Metatrader 4 platform.</li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          Opening copied trades routine:
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li className="mb-1">The Copier only copies the trades that were opened by the Master after the subscription for the Master within the Service.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">Stop loss/take profit orders will not be visible in the Copier Area, but if these orders are triggered on the Master’s account, the copied trades are also closed.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">Upon the subscription to a Master, the Copier specifies the amount of funds to be deducted from the Wallet and invested with the selected Master. These funds and your profit will return to your Wallet when you stop copying the Master.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">The Copier can choose to copy the Master's orders in an equal (×1), double (×2), triple (×3), or any other proportion. Copying mode, as well as the investment required for start, is selected at the time of subscription to the Master.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">The Copiers’ leverage ratio is set at 1:500. The Copiers willing to adjust it need to contact the Prime’s Customer Support.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">Once the service is activated, the trades will be copied to the Copier’s account regardless of whether the owner of the account is signed in or not.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">The Copier's order is executed following the order (Buy or Sell) made in the Master's account. When the Master places an order, the signal for opening an order triggers in the Copier's account. The Copier's order is executed at the market's price. The same mechanism triggers the order closing. Therefore, the execution prices of these orders may differ. Additionally, the number of the Copiers following this Master can affect the execution time.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">In case of significant delays in opening and closing orders due to technical reasons, the Service may cancel the Copiers' orders without prior notice.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">
          Limits applied:
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6">
            <li className="mb-1">The minimum volume of the copied trade is 0.01 lot, the maximum volume of a copied trade is 100 lots.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">The minimum copied order volume is 0.01 lots. However, copied orders with a volume below 0.005 lots will be refused, while copied trades from 0.005 lots and above will be rounded to 0.01 lots.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">The volume of any order is rounded to the nearest hundredth decimal point (the second digit after the decimal). For instance, if the Copier copies an order for 0.324 lots, the order will be rounded down to 0.32 lots. Vice versa, if the Copier copies an order for 0.325 lots, the order will be rounded up to 0.33 lots.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">If the copied trade volume is bigger than 100 lots after the calculation is made, then the trade will not be opened on the Copier account.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">If the Master changes equity (by making a deposit or withdrawal) or leverage, all the copied trades maintain their initial volume on the Copier’s account.</li>
        <li className="mb-2">All trading conditions (leverage, swaps, spreads) of the Copiers’ are similar to the ones for the Prime MT4 accounts.</li>
        <li className="mb-2">The Master Account should be of Prime MT4 type.</li>
        <li className="mb-2">

            <li className="mb-1">monitor the Master Trader's activity on the platform, mark the Master Trader's account with the ‘Suspicious activity’ warning if the Master Trader manipulates their statistics, and exclude such account from the Master Rating filtered by default (will keep it available for the Copiers who change their filter settings accordingly).</li>
            <li className="mb-1">amend or delete the Master's nickname and (or) user picture without prior notice if the Service reasonably suspects that such Master deliberately copies or imitates others Master’s nickname and (or) picture which may lead to dishonest representation of the Master.</li>
            <li className="mb-1">stop trading activity on the Master Account and close open orders without prior notice. The Master Trader will be able to withdraw funds from such Master Account or transfer them to another trading account and continue trading on any other trading account available.</li>

        </li>
        <li className="mb-2">The Master determines the commission amount for copying orders. The commission can range from 0% to 50% of the Copier's gain. Commission charges accumulated within one week are paid out to the Master's Wallet on Sundays.</li>
        <li className="mb-2">The commission amount that the Copier pays to the Master is set at the moment when the Copier presses ‘Start Copying’. If the Master changes the commission amount, it does not affect the amount due under this subscription to the Master.</li>
        <li className="mb-2">Commission amounts for the IB. The Master can also be an IB for the Copier. In this case, they will receive the IB commission with a coefficient of 0.5 and the commission for copying in full.</li>
